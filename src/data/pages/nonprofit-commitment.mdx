# Dedicated to nonprofit law firms

Blawby is committed to reducing digital and administrative barriers for nonprofit legal aid organizations, empowering them to expand access to justice for underserved populations.

## Our Mission

We develop and maintain secure, affordable digital tools that support IOLTA-compliant accounting, client intake, and operational efficiency. Our work centers on helping mission-driven legal providers—especially small and resource-constrained nonprofits—access the infrastructure they need to carry out their charitable missions.

## Primary Services at Discounted Rates

Our core payment processing platform offers nonprofit legal aid organizations discounted access to the same professional-grade tools used by for-profit firms. This includes:

- **Secure payment processing** with credit card and ACH support
- **IOLTA compliance** built-in by default
- **Dynamic payment links** for easy client payments
- **Real-time notifications** and tracking
- **Professional branding** on all payment pages
- **Comprehensive audit trails** for compliance

Qualified nonprofits receive significant discounts on our [standard pricing](/pricing) to help reduce operational costs and expand their ability to serve more clients.

## Open Source Development for the Public Good

In addition to offering subsidized tools to nonprofits, we maintain and actively develop multiple open-source platforms that are freely available to the public and designed to serve the legal aid sector:

### Automatic Lawyer Workflow Tool

A fully open-source IOLTA-compliant workflow tool that includes payments, time entry, retainer tracking, reminders, and client communication — provided at no cost.

### AI-Enhanced Legal Intake Chatbot

A free, open-source intake form and chatbot platform that helps legal practices validate client requests and manage their intake process efficiently. This helps reduce overhead for small legal aid providers and improves access to services for the public.

**[View on GitHub](https://github.com/pcl-labs/preact-cloudflare-intake-chatbot)**

These tools serve the public directly by:

- Supporting legal providers who serve indigent or underserved communities
- Lowering the cost of ethical compliance for legal aid organizations
- Creating a replicable infrastructure that any qualifying organization can use at no cost
