## Problem

**Small firms run on paper, people, and processes that kill billable time.**

- Many small firms still rely on **paper invoices, mailed checks, and manual retainer billing.**
- **Scheduling and intake are human-intensive** â€” staff chase down clients, follow up by phone/email, and track time by hand.
- **IOLTA compliance is unforgiving** â€” using Stripe or PayPal can mean disbarment if fees touch trust funds.
- Current tools are either **outdated and clunky** (LawPay) or **overbuilt for small firms** (Clio).

*Lawyers spend hours on work that generates zero revenue and risks their license.*

*Blawby frees lawyers from admin so they can bill more, stress less, and stay compliant.*
