## How AI Intake Works

### Intelligent Conversations That Understand Legal Context

Unlike static forms that ask the same questions regardless of the legal issue, Blawby AI adapts its conversation based on what the client shares. The system understands legal terminology, recognizes urgency, and asks relevant follow-up questions.

For example, when a client says "I got fired for downloading movies on my work laptop," Blawby AI immediately recognizes this as an employment law matter and begins collecting the specific information needed for that type of case.

### Step-by-Step Information Collection

Blawby AI guides clients through a natural conversation that collects all necessary information:

1. **Initial Assessment**: Blawby AI understands the client's legal situation and categorizes the matter
2. **Contact Information**: Collects name, phone, and email systematically
3. **Matter Details**: Asks relevant questions based on the legal issue type
4. **Payment Processing**: Handles consultation fees automatically
5. **Next Steps**: Provides clear guidance on what happens next

### Human-in-the-Loop Review

Complex or urgent matters are automatically escalated to your review queue, ensuring that sensitive cases get human attention while routine matters are handled efficiently by Blawby AI.
