# Managing Clients

Blawby makes it easy for law firms to manage their clients. The Clients section lets you add, update, and remove clients, and track all client activity in one place.

To manage your clients, visit [Clients](https://blawby.com/clients). If you are logged in, this link will automatically redirect you to the correct team page for your account.

## Overview

- Add, update, or remove clients from your firm
- View a timeline of all client-related events (invoices, payments, communications)
- Import clients in bulk from a CSV file

> To learn how to send invoices or track payment status, see [Invoicing](/invoicing) and [Payments](/payments).

## Adding and Managing Clients

Add new clients or update existing client information in the Clients section of your dashboard. For each client, you can store:
- Name
- Email
- Phone number
- Address
- Status (Lead or Client)

You can edit or remove clients at any time. Removing a client will detach them from your firm, but their historical data is preserved for compliance.

## Client Timeline

Each client profile includes a timeline that tracks all important events:
- Invoices sent and their status
- Payments received
- Communications and notes

This helps you keep a complete record of your relationship with each client.

## Importing Clients

To import clients in bulk:

1. Download the CSV template from the Import Clients page
2. Fill in your client data (Name, Email, Phone, etc.)
3. Upload the completed CSV file using the import tool
4. Review and confirm the imported data before finalizing

If there are any errors (such as missing required fields), Blawby will show you which rows need attention so you can correct and re-upload.
