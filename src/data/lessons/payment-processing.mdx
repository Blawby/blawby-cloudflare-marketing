## How Payment Links Work

### Fast, Frictionless Payments for Every Client

With Blawby, you can generate a payment link in seconds—no technical setup required. Whether you're onboarding a new client, collecting a retainer, or following up on an outstanding invoice, payment links make it easy for clients to pay you online, from any device.

For example, when a client calls to ask how to pay their retainer, you can send them a secure payment link by email or text. They pay instantly, and both of you receive a receipt—no delays, no confusion.

### Creating and Sharing Payment Links

1. Go to **Settings** in your Blawby dashboard.
2. Click on your Team name.
3. Scroll to the **Payment Link** section.
4. Enter a unique link name (e.g., `myfirm-payments`) and an optional default amount.
5. Save your changes.
6. Copy your payment link (e.g., `https://blawby.com/myfirm-payments`).

**Best Practices:**
- Add your payment link to your website as a "Pay Now" button.
- Include it in your email signature or on invoices.
- Send it directly to clients for retainers, one-off payments, or outstanding balances.

## Tracking and Managing Payments

Blawby does not currently provide an in-app payment dashboard. Instead, all payments are managed through Blawby and can be tracked and reconciled in your own Stripe account or accounting software. This approach gives you the flexibility to use the financial tools you already trust for reporting and reconciliation.

If you ever need to request a specific amount, you can pre-fill the payment form by adding an `amount` parameter to your link. **Blawby payment links use a bigint for the amount, so for example:**

`https://blawby.com/northcarolinalegalservices/pay?amount=10000` = $100
