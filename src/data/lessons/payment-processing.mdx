## Payment Links

Blawby lets you create payment links that you can share with clients for fast, secure online payments. These links provide a simple checkout experience, complete with your firm's branding and automated email receipts.

### Creating a Payment Link

1. Go to **Settings** in your Blawby dashboard.
2. Click on your Team name.
3. Scroll down to the **Payment Link** section.
4. Enter a unique link name (e.g., `myfirm-payments`) and an optional default amount.
5. Save your changes.
6. Copy your payment link (e.g., `https://blawby.com/myfirm-payments`).

### How Clients Use Your Payment Link

- Clients visit your payment link to access a secure checkout page.
- They can enter their payment details and submit payment by card or ACH.
- After payment, clients receive an email receipt automatically.
- You will also receive a payment email notifying you of the payment.
- You and your team can track all payments in your Blawby dashboard.

### Best Practices for Sharing Payment Links

- Add your payment link to your website as a "Pay Now" button.
- Include it in your email signature or on invoices.
- Send it directly to clients for retainers, one-off payments, or outstanding balances.

### Tracking and Managing Payments

All payments received through your payment link are visible in the **Payments** dashboard:
- View payment status and history

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- If your payment link isn't working, ensure your payout account and payment method are set up in your account settings.
- You can pre-fill the payment amount by adding an `amount` parameter to your payment link URL. For example:

  `https://blawby.com/your-link-name?amount=1000`

  This will pre-fill the payment form with $10.00. The amount is specified in cents, so 1000 = $10.00, 2525 = $25.25, and so on.

  This makes it easy to request specific payment amounts for different clients or services by simply changing the URL.

## Compliance

Blawby ensures compliance with legal industry standards:

- Automatic separation of earned and unearned fees

> **Warning**: Always consult with your accountant to ensure proper handling of client funds, especially regarding trust accounts.
