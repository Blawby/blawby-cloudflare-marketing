## Overview

Streamline your billing process with Blawby's powerful invoicing features designed for legal professionals.

> **Note:** All invoices must have a due date set for at least the next day. If you need to collect a payment immediately (same-day), use a [Payment Link](/payment-processing) instead. Payment links allow clients to pay you instantly, without waiting for an invoice due date.
