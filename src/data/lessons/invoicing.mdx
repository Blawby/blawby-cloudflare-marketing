# Invoicing with Blawby

Blawby makes it easy for law firms to create, send, and manage professional invoices for their clients.

To manage your invoices, visit [Invoicing](https://app.blawby.com/invoicing).

## Overview

Streamline your billing process with Blawby's powerful invoicing features designed for legal professionals.

> **Note:** All invoices must have a due date set for at least the next day. If you need to collect a payment immediately (same-day), use a [Payment Link](/payments) instead. Payment links allow clients to pay you instantly, without waiting for an invoice due date.

## Creating Invoices

To create a new invoice:

1. Navigate to "Invoices" > "Create New Invoice"
2. Select a client from your list or add a new one
3. Add line items for your legal services:
   - Description of service
   - Time spent (if billing hourly)
   - Rate
   - Flat fee (if applicable)
4. Set the due date
5. Preview the invoice
6. Click "Send" to email the invoice to your client


> For details on managing clients, including adding, updating, and importing clients, see [Managing Clients](/clients).

## After Creating an Invoice

Once you have created and sent an invoice, an email is automatically sent to your client requesting payment. This email includes a link that directs them to the payment page, where they can choose from various payment options. For more information on payment options, visit [Payments](/payments).

## Payment Confirmation

After a payment is successfully processed, both you and your client will receive a payment confirmation email. This ensures that both parties have a record of the transaction, providing peace of mind and a clear audit trail.
