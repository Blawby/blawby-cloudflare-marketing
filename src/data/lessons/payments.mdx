## How Payment Links Work

### Fast, Frictionless Payments for Every Client

With Blawby, you can generate a payment link in seconds—no technical setup required. Whether you're onboarding a new client, collecting a retainer, or following up on an outstanding invoice, payment links make it easy for clients to pay you online, from any device.

For example, when a client calls to ask how to pay their retainer, you can send them a secure payment link by email or text. They pay instantly, and both of you receive a receipt—no delays, no confusion.

## Using Dynamic Payment Links

Blawby's dynamic payment links are designed to save you time by allowing you to adjust the payment amount directly in the URL, without needing to log into the CMS. This feature enables any automation system or CMS to manipulate the URL parameter to dynamically prepare always-ready, no-code payment link pages.

### Adjusting the Payment Amount

To change the payment amount, simply modify the `amount` parameter in the URL. The amount is specified in cents, so for example, to request a payment of $75.00, you would use:

`https://blawby.com/myfirm-payments?amount=7500`

This flexibility means you can generate payment links on-the-fly, tailored to each client's needs, without the hassle of creating a new link each time. This not only streamlines your payment process but also enhances your firm's efficiency by reducing administrative tasks.

## Advanced Features for Scaling Firms

### Smarter Link Generation with URL Parameters

Blawby lets you generate custom payment links quickly by changing the amount in the URL—no logins, no integrations, and no coding required.

You can:

- Pre-fill specific payment amounts for faster transactions
- Share the same link across channels with client-specific amounts
- Embed links into emails, CMS pages, or SMS workflows

**Example:**

`https://blawby.com/myfirm-payments?amount=12500` (For a $125.00 payment request)

This keeps your payment process streamlined and makes it easy to create dynamic, client-specific links on-the-fly.

### Custom Branding and Experience

Each payment page includes your firm's logo, name, email address, and phone number—so clients know exactly who they're paying. This ensures a clear, professional presentation without the need for additional customization or legal disclaimers.

### Real-Time Notifications & Tracking

Get notified instantly when a payment is completed. Track status via the dashboard or webhook events to update your systems in real-time.
