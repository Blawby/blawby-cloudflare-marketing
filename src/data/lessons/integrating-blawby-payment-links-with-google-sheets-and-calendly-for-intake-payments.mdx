# How I Simplified Consultation Payments for My Law Practice

When I first started my law practice, I was spending way too much time chasing down consultation payments. Clients would call, we'd schedule a meeting, and then I'd have to follow up multiple times to get paid. It was frustrating for everyone involved. My paralegal was spending hours each week on payment follow-ups, and I was losing valuable time that could be spent on client work.

That's when I discovered Blawby's payment links. Now, when potential clients reach out, they can pay for their consultation instantly with a simple link. It's been a game-changer for my practice, and my team couldn't be happier with the streamlined process.

## The Problem I Was Facing

I was stuck in a cycle of:

- Spending hours following up for payments
- Juggling multiple systems to track who paid
- Losing focus on my actual legal work
- Wasting time on administrative tasks that could be automated
- My team spending too much time on payment collection
- Clients getting confused about how to pay

I knew there had to be a better way to handle consultation payments. After all, I started my practice to help clients, not to chase payments.

## My Solution: Simple Payment Links

Here's how I set up my consultation payment system:

1. **Created a Payment Link** (2 minutes)
   - Went to my Blawby dashboard
   - Navigated to Settings
   - Created a payment link called "consultation"
   - Set my standard consultation fee of $75
   - Added my firm's branding to the payment page
   - Verified the payment setup met all professional requirements

2. **Made It Dynamic** (1 minute)
   - Added the amount parameter to my URL
   - Example: `https://blawby.com/myfirm-payments?amount=7500` for $75
   - This lets me adjust amounts as needed
   - Created different links for different types of consultations

## My Complete Automation Setup

I've set up a seamless system using Zapier to handle everything automatically. Here's how it works:

1. **Calendly to Notion Flow**
   - When someone books a consultation:
     - Zapier creates a new client in my Notion database
     - Sets their status as "Pending Payment"
     - Records their consultation date and time
     - Stores their contact information
     - Adds a note about the payment link

2. **Payment Tracking Flow**
   - When I receive a Blawby payment notification email:
     - Zapier reads the email
     - Extracts the payment amount and client name
     - Finds the matching client in Notion
     - Updates their status to "Paid"
     - Records the payment date and amount
     - Adds a confirmation note

3. **Booking Confirmation Flow**
   - For clients who haven't paid within 24 hours:
     - Zapier checks their status in Notion
     - If still "Pending Payment":
       - Cancels their Calendly booking
       - Sends them a polite cancellation email
       - Updates their status to "Cancelled"
       - Adds a note about the cancellation

This automation has been a game-changer for my practice. I don't have to worry about:

- Manually tracking payments
- Following up with clients
- Cancelling unpaid bookings
- Updating client records

## How I Integrated It with My Workflow

I've made the payment link work seamlessly with my existing tools:

- **Scheduling:** I added the payment link to my booking confirmation emails. When a client books a consultation, they receive an email that includes:
  - Their appointment details
  - A clear note that payment is required to confirm the consultation
  - The payment link with the exact amount
  - Instructions on how to complete the payment
  - A professional, branded presentation
  - All necessary payment disclosures
    This ensures clients know exactly what they need to do to secure their appointment.

- **Client Management:** My paralegal can easily track payments alongside client information, making it simple to follow up if needed. We've set up a system where:
  - All payments are automatically recorded
  - Payment status is clearly visible
  - Follow-up reminders are automated
  - Client history is maintained

- **Website:** Added a prominent "Schedule Consultation" button that my team can easily update. The button:
  - Matches our firm's branding
  - Is mobile-friendly
  - Provides clear next steps
  - Creates a professional first impression

## The Results I've Seen

Since implementing this system, I've noticed:

- 90% reduction in payment follow-up time
- More professional client experience
- Better cash flow management
- Fewer administrative headaches
- My team spends less time on payment collection
