## Quick Start Guide

Use the following steps to get started with Blawby:

1. **Sign Up for a Blawby Account.** (2 minutes) Visit [https://blawby.com](https://blawby.com) and click **Sign Up**. Enter your email address and create a secure password. Provide your law firm's details and complete the verification process. For more information, see [Setting Up Payouts](/payouts).
2. **Set Up Your Account.** (5 minutes) Connect your bank account by going to [External payout accounts](https://blawby.com/settings/payouts) in your dashboard and following the prompts to add your firm's bank account for payouts.

3. **Get Your Custom Payment Link.** (2 minutes) In your dashboard, go to **Settings** and select your Team name.

Save your changes and copy your payment link (e.g., `https://blawby.com/myfirm-payments`). You can pre-fill the payment amount by adding an `amount` parameter to your link, such as `https://blawby.com/your-link-name?amount=1000` for $10.00 (amount is in cents).
