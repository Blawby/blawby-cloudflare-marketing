# 🧠 LLM Blog Post Writing Ruleset

A structured guide for large language models to follow when generating blog posts within our editorial system. These rules define tone, structure, formatting, research expectations, SEO compliance, and more.

---

## 📌 Purpose

This blog is a content marketing arm of a product offering — a **payment solution for law firms and solo attorneys**.

- Blog posts are designed to build authority, educate legal professionals, answer search-driven questions, and **subtly guide readers toward adopting the product**.
- Content focuses **exclusively on law firm business management**, not legal theory or counsel.
- We serve attorneys and staff who are ready to scale and optimize — not by working more, but by using smarter tools.
- Every post must be **problem-solving in nature**: help the reader fix something, grow something, or streamline something.
- While doing so, **drip in product relevance**: the tool should feel like a natural part of the solution — not a plug.

---

## 🧠 Content Focus

Content must speak to one or more of these four legal personas:

### 👩‍⚖️ 1. Ambitious, Efficiency-Seeking Solo or Small Firm Attorneys
- Want to grow but are bogged down by operations  
- Open to tech, but not if it's bloated or complicated  
**Message:**  
> "Don't let technology slow down your business. Use smarter tools to take care of less — and do more of what you're great at."

---

### 🧑‍💼 2. Highly Experienced but Tech-Outdated Attorneys
- Decades of skill, but still rely on manual tools or legacy processes  
**Message:**  
> "You've mastered your craft — now let the tools around you catch up."

---

### 🧑‍🎓 3. New or Early-Career Attorneys Starting Their Firm
- Juggling every task themselves  
**Message:**  
> "Don't let running the business get in the way of growing the business."

---

### 👩‍💻 4. Paralegals, Office Managers, Legal Assistants in Mid-to-Large Firms
- Often the first to advocate for process updates  
**Message:**  
> "If you're the one keeping everything running, you deserve tools that make your job easier."

---

## 🔁 Shared Product Relevance

All personas benefit from:
- Faster collections, fewer follow-ups  
- Streamlined payments and admin  
- Low-friction, professional operations  
- A system that works *for* them — not the other way around

---

## ✍️ Tone & Voice

- Tone must be: clear, confident, intelligent, respectful of time  
- Always focus on **solving problems, removing friction, or enabling growth**  
- No jargon unless defined  
- Use first or second person. Speak directly to the reader's actual experience.

### Sample tones by persona:

- **New lawyer:** "You're doing everything yourself. Let's fix the part that takes the longest."  
- **Legal assistant:** "If you're still chasing payments manually, this is going to change your life."  
- **Veteran attorney:** "You don't need to overhaul your system — just upgrade the part that's costing you hours."

---

## 🧱 Structure & Formatting

## 🔤 MDX Formatting & Component Use

LLMs must generate output using valid `.mdx` syntax, compatible with JSX-aware static site generators (e.g. Next.js, Astro, or MDX-based CMS). Formatting must support both clean HTML fallback and optional reusable components.

### ✅ Use the Following Markdown Elements Normally:

- `#` for H1 — used for the post title only  
- `##`, `###` for H2/H3 subheaders  
- `*` or `-` for bullet lists  
- `1.` for ordered lists  
- `> blockquote` only for genuine quotes — do not overuse for stylistic callouts  
- `**bold**` and _italic_ for emphasis, not style

### 🚫 Do Not Use:

- Raw HTML (e.g., `<p>`, `<br>`, `<h2>`)  
- Inline `<style>` or class attributes  
- JSX event handlers or custom script tags  
- Custom CSS — styling is handled by the site's design system
- **Custom React components in MDX (including CTA, Callout, FAQ) unless explicitly allowed.**

### ⚠️ MDX Content Should:

- Be clean, readable, and copy-ready  
- Work as-is without requiring dev cleanup  
- Respect component usage limits: **1 CTA per post (written in plain Markdown/MDX, not as a component)**, max **1 Callout block** unless otherwise allowed

---

## 📣 Call to Action (CTA)

Every blog must end with a CTA that feels like a **natural resolution** to the problem addressed.

- **Write the CTA in plain Markdown/MDX (e.g., heading, paragraph, and link), not as a custom component.**
- Soft pitch only — always tied to the pain discussed  
- Varies by persona (solo vs. admin vs. senior)

**Example:**

> ## Ready to Launch?
> Start your firm on the right foot. Let Blawby handle payments and compliance—so you can focus on building your practice. [Register for Blawby](mdc:https:/blawby.com/register)

---

## 🔍 SEO & Discoverability

- Use **real long-tail search phrases** relevant to legal ops:  
  - "how to accept credit card payments as a lawyer"  
  - "law firm trust account compliance"  
  - "legal payment automation tools"

- Ensure they appear in:
  - H1  
  - H2/H3 headings  
  - Body and meta descriptions (lightly)

### 🧠 Decode Complex Terms

If a keyword is unfamiliar or technical:

- Define it early, briefly, then move on  

**Example:**  
> "Trust accounting — the process of holding client funds separately — can be easy to get wrong…"

---

## 🕵️ Competitor Gap Research (Internal Use Only — Never Visible in Output)

Before drafting, the model must review blog content from key competitors:

- [LawPay.com/blog](mdc:https:/www.lawpay.com/about/blog)
- [Clio.com/blog](mdc:https:/www.clio.com/blog)

This research is used to inform:
- What topics are currently being addressed in the legal payment and firm operations space  
- What questions are left unanswered  
- What areas are oversimplified or shallow  
- What personas are not being spoken to

**Key Objective:**  
Identify factual or strategic gaps — and ensure the blog post fills them better.

### ✅ Implementation Guidelines

- Use competitor content to shape what information is included — not how it is written.
- Use it to raise the bar on:
  - Depth of explanation  
  - Relevance to multiple personas  
  - Practicality of solutions

### 🚫 Absolute Restrictions

> **Competitor research is strictly for internal calibration. It must never appear in the blog post.**

- No "how this post is different" sections  
- No competitor names mentioned, directly or indirectly  
- No reference to "other blogs," "unlike other solutions," or similar comparative framing  
- No visible meta-commentary or editorial framing that acknowledges other content

The result should feel authoritative and complete on its own — **not reactionary** or comparative.
